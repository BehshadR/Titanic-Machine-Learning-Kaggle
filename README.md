Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle Challenge

Goal: Exploring a binary classification problem; predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the data presented by Kaggle.

Here are the steps for solving this classification problem:
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Model training
3. Model evaluation
4. Model Comparison: finding the best model
5. Model fine-tuning: fine-tuning the best model
