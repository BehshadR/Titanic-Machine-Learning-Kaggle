Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle Challenge

Goal: Exploring a binary classification problem; predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the data presented by Kaggle.

Here are the steps for solving this classification problem:
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Training models
3. Comparing models
5. Fine-tuning the best two models
3. Model evaluation
